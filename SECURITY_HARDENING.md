Security and misuse controls implemented in this codebase.

- Offline by default:
  - `control_panel/state.json` ships with `web_access: false`, `llm_enabled: false`.
- Allowlist-only web access:
  - `web_check/allowlist.json` defines permitted domains.
  - `web_check/fetcher.py` enforces allowlist and denies when web access is disabled.
- Rate limiting and input bounds:
  - `bridge/server.py` caps 30 requests/min per client and refuses inputs >4k chars.
- Action safety:
  - Cognitive control redirects risky states to refuse/silence/step-by-step.
  - Tutor execution is deterministic; no free-form generation.
- Reward shaping discourages unsafe behavior:
  - `core_intelligence/rewards.py` rewards refusal and silence when appropriate.
- Profile integrity:
  - Profiles are validated (`architecture/profiles.py`) and persisted centrally via control panel state.
- Data retention:
  - Interactions logged to local SQLite only; no network exfiltration.
- Web fetch isolation:
  - Fetched content not fed into learning (only returned to caller).
- CLI/server surface minimization:
  - Only documented commands/routes are exposed; unknown paths/commands return errors.
